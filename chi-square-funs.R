  #quantiles are along the time axis for both Correct and Error responses.
  #These quantiles will form the edges of RT "bins" in the data, which are
  #used for parameter estimation using the chi-square method.
  
  #Matlab has an in-built function for extracting quantiles, which I use
  #here, but you can also do this manually by sorting RTs from fastest to
  #slowest (for, say, corrects), and then figuring out where the 10th, 30th,
  #50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles of the data are along the time axis.

  #Estimating parameters using the chi-square method means that we need a way
  #of aggregating the data so that we can compare predictions against
  #observations.
  
  #Due to how quantiles are defined, we know the proportion of observations
  #that are within each bin. For example, the proportion of observations
  #that are between the 0.1 and 0.3 quantiles is equal to 0.2 (i.e., 0.3 -
  #0.1 = 0.2). It follows that the data for any experiment, when binned
  #according to the RT quantiles we are interested in, will be:
  #[0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1]
  #However, we need to scale these values by the observed correct/error rates
  #so that the proportion of observations sum to 1.

  #What we now need to do is compare diffusion model predictions to our
  #empirical data. To do so, we will need to compare the predicted proportion
  #of responses that fall within the empirically defined RT quantiles (i.e.,
  #the bin edges defined by "binedge_c" and "binedge_e"). If the model
  #perfectly matches the data, the expected proportions will equal the
  #observed proportions (i.e., the data vectors defined by "bindata_c" and
